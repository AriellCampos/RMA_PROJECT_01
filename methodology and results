Metodoly

As a first step, we performed the installation of turtlebot3 in the workspace.
After installation, we copy the available map to turtlebot3's maps folder.
We created a new .launch based on Turtlebot3 .launch (turtlebot3_maze.launch), put maze.world and RVIZ to boot along with the gazebo.
We create the maze.py script that sends the desired position to /move_base and add the script call in turtlebot3_maze.launch

Results
After performing these steps when starting the launch with the commands:

- $source ~/.bashrc
- $cd /workspace
- $export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
- $roslaunch ros_autonomous_slam turtlebot3_maze.launch

The gazebo features the maze with the turtlebot3 waffle_pi leaving the starting point and going to the destination point.
